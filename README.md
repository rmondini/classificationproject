# Rain in Australia

I work on the 'Rain in Australia' Kaggle dataset. The dataset contains daily weather observations from Australian weather stations.   

I train several binary classifiers (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, neural network) to predict whether or not it will rain the following day. I consider and study several metrics (classification report and the corresponding confusion matrix, ROC curve and AUC) to determine which model performs better.
