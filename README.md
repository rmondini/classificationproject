# raininaustralia

We use the 'Rain in Australia' Kaggle dataset. The datasets contains daily weather observations from Australian weather stations.   

We train several binary classification models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, neural network) to predict whether or not it will rain the following day. We consider and study several metrics (classification report and the corresponding confusion matrix, ROC curve and AUC) to determine which model performs better.
